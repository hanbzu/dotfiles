dotfiles.git
============
Clone and run this on a 'blank' machine to configure a working development environment:

```sh
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/startup-class/dotfiles.git
dotfiles/setup.sh
```

Bear in mind that the programs that some of these configuration files refer to may not be installed. Install them first.

A backup copy is made out of each replaced dotfile.

More additional setup files are included for specific frameworks or IDEs.
